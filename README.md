# A Probabilistic Programming Language for Random Networks

You can run `benchmark.py` to evaluate the triangle counting algorithms we outline in the paper. Similarly, you can use `benchplots.py` to generate the benchmarking plots for the paper.

## Dependency Setup

Running the library requires a few libraries that can be installed with `pip`; we've frozen our environment to `requirements.txt`. We developed this on the latest version of Python at the time, Python 3.11.

To install all the relevant libraries, run:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
